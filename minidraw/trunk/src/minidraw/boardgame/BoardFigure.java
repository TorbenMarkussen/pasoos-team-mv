/**
 * A Figure specifically representing some object in a board game,
 * like a checker, a die, a card, or some other actionable object
 * like a button.
 * <p/>
 * There are two types: moveable objects (like checkers that
 * can be moved by the mouse), and props (like a die that cannot be moved
 * but only clicked to perform some action).
 * <p/>
 * The BoardFigure role is intimately related to the BoardActionTool role
 * as they have a well defined protocol:
 * <p/>
 * A BoardActionTool will ONLY click or move BoardFigure objects. Once
 * the tool's mouse up event is called, the method 'performAction' is
 * called on the BoardFigure.
 * <p/>
 * A BoardFigure must be associated a command object, i.e. an instance
 * of a command pattern. It is this object's 'execute' method that
 * gets invoked on mouse up events from the BoardActionTool.
 * <p/>
 * This source code is from the book
 * "Flexible, Reliable Software:
 * Using Patterns and Agile Development"
 * published 2010 by CRC Press.
