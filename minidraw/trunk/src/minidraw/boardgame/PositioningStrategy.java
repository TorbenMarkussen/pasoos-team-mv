/**
 * This role defines a strategy (strategy pattern) encapsulating the
 * algorithms to calculate the proper graphical position (x,y) for a
 * figure that is located on a given location on a board game.
 * <p/>
 * Collaborators: BoardDrawing that uses this strategy during
 * initialization of the collection of figures (to position figures
 * correctly based upon the game's layout of pieces) and during
 * moves (to adjust a user's inaccurate dragging of a figure representing
 * a figure).
 * <p/>
 * The typical example is a mouse drag of a chess piece to a square.
 * In most cases the piece will not be positioned by the user on
 * the exact center position of the square. The BoardDrawing will
 * request its PositioningStrategy object to calculate the correct
 * central position and then move the figure for perfect centering.
 * <p/>
 * Invariant: The positions returned by the calculate method must be
 * non-overlapping for disjoint locations. That is, if positions
 * returned by the positioning strategy for location X could be
 * mistaken as belonging to location Y, MiniDraw.BoardGame will become very
 * confused. The user will probably as well.
